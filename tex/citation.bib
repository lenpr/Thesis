abstract = {An architecture is presented for fast high-quality rendering of complex images. All objects are reduced to common world- space geometric entities called micropolygons, and all of the shading and visibility calculations operate on these micropo- lygons. Each type of calculation is performed in a coordinate system that is natural for that type of calculation. Micropo- lygons are created and textured in the local coordinate system of the object, with the result that texture filtering is simplified and improved. Visibility is calculated in screen space using stochas- tic point sampling with a z buffer. There are no clipping or inverse perspective calculations. Geometric and texture locality are exploited to minimize paging and to support models that contain arbitrarily many primitives.},

@article{Campen2012,
abstract = {We present a theoretical framework and practical method for the automatic construction of simple, all-quadrilateral patch layouts on manifold surfaces. The resulting layouts are coarse, surface- embedded cell complexes well adapted to the geometric structure, hence they are ideally suited as domains and base complexes for surface parameterization, spline fitting, or subdivision surfaces and can be used to generate quad meshes with a high-level patch struc- ture that are advantageous in many application scenarios. Our ap- proach is based on the careful construction of the layout graph’s combinatorial dual. In contrast to the primal this dual perspective provides direct control over the globally interdependent structural constraints inherent to quad layouts. The dual layout is built from curvature-guided, crossing loops on the surface. A novel method to construct these efficiently in a geometry- and structure-aware man- ner constitutes the core of our approach.},

@misc{Seymour2012,
abstract = {Once considered a commodity item in the whole CG / VFX world – rendering is now a hot topic. CG supervisor Scott Metzger jokes that one can’t talk about renderers without annoying someone. “Renderers are like religion (laughs). Rendering is a religion! Especially now in this era, which is really really exciting, there is so much going on and there are so many renderers, so much happening. To me it is the most exciting part of being in our industry right now.”},

annote = {As Dana Batali, Vice President of RenderMan products at Pixar commented,  “Rendering drives the largest computational budget of getting the pixels to the screen.” ... ‘sims’ (physical sims like cloth etc) were only about 5\% of most film’s computation budgets
        
        
“Arnold is able to handle very dense scenes well beyond what Softimage is able to represent in the viewport. We have built our asset publishing system, “Distill”, around the Arnold asset types. This allows us to abstract asset complexity from Softimage and layout/render very complex scenes. Our typical rendered scenes contain over 140 million triangles across thousands of objects though we have pushed over 1 billion polygons within 24 GB of ram.
        
Most of the RAM used by a renderer goes for the description of the scene geometry and the material textures. “With geometry we are not talking about instances, but unique polygons,” notes Koylazov. “Scenes with many objects and especially with displaced or subdivided surfaces can come down to millions of triangles. And then there is hair and fur where often millions of hair strands are needed to achieve a realistic result. If there is enough RAM to hold the entire scene data, then all is well and good, but sometimes scenes are so complex that they don’t fit in the available RAM.
        
All companies at some time need to set an agenda. Given modo’s current growth and the great user adoption of the 601 version we asked Hastings, “if you had to rate speed vs able to deal with huge files vs features – where is your focus moving forward?” He responded, “We have plans for improvements in all three areas. If I had to pick just one it would probably be huge scenes.”},

The aim of this reading and project-based course is to examine key ideas, trends, and challenges associated with the design of architectures and systems responsible for efficiently executing these workloads. This course begins with an in-depth study of the real-time graphics pipeline architecture and the efficiency of its modern GPU implementations. Key topics include the design of GPU processing and communication resources, graphics pipeline components and their scheduling on heterogeneous, parallel hardware, and how current abstractions balance conflicting needs for both efficiency and programmability. The second part of the course will address system design challenges in a broader array of emerging visual computing topics including: image processing architectures for mobile computing, programmable camera platforms, alternative graphics pipelines, and GPU-accelerated interfaces for application domains beyond graphics. This course is intended for systems/graphics students interested in architecting future graphics or image processing platforms and for students interested in gaining experience designing applications or programming frameworks for emerging heterogeneous, parallel systems.},

These include thousands of photographs of virtually every famous place, taken from a multitude of viewpoints, at many different times of day, and under a variety of weather conditions. This thesis addresses the problem of leveraging such photos to create new 3D interfaces for virtually exploring our world. One key challenge is that recreating 3D scenes from photo collections requires knowing where each photo was taken. This thesis introduces new computer vision techniques that robustly recover such information from photo collections without requiring GPS or other instrumentation. These methods are the first to be demonstrated on Internet imagery, and show that 3D reconstruction techniques can be successfully applied to this rich, largely untapped resource. For this problem scale is a particular concern, as Internet collections can be extremely large. I introduce an efficient reconstruction algorithm that selects a small skeletal set of images as a preprocess. This approach can reduce reconstruction time by an order of magnitude with little or no loss in completeness or accuracy.},

abstract = {Visual Effects Production, despite being fundamentally an artistic endeavor, is a very technically oriented business. Like many other businesses in their early ages, it still requires constant innovation and in many cases a great amount of craftsmanship. Given these premises, most VFX companies (especially those at the leading edge) are hungry for novel and better solutions to the problems they encounter everyday. Many published machine vision algorithms are designed to be real-time and fully automatic with low computational complexity. These attributes are essential for applications such as robotic vision, but in most cases overkill or ill-conditioned for Motion Picture Digital Visual Effects facilities, where massive computation resources are commonplace and expert human interaction is available to initialise algorithms and to guide them towards an optimal solution. Conversely, motion pictures have significantly higher accuracy requirements and other unique challenges. Not all machine vision algorithms can readily be adapted to this environment. This talk outlines the requirements of visual effects and indicate several challenges and possible solutions involved in adopting image processing and machine vision algorithms for motion picture visual effects.},

This need is not only due to rendering speed reasons, but also to allow fast transmission of 3D models in network-based applications. Many different approaches and algorithms for mesh simplification have been proposed in the last few years. We present a survey and a characterization of the fundamental methods. Moreover, the results of an empirical comparison of the simplification codes available in the public domain are discussed. Five implementations, chosen to give a wide spectrum of different topology preserving methods, were run on a set of sample surfaces. We compared empirical computational complexities and the approximation accuracy of the resulting output meshes.},

@inproceedings{Hinker1993,
abstract = {An algorithm is presented which describes an application independent method for reducing the number of polygonal primitives required to faithfully represent an object. Reducing polygon count without a corresponding reduction in object detail is important for: achieving interactive frame rates in scientific visualization, reducing mass storage requirements, and facilitating the transmission of large, multi-timestep geometric data sets. This paper shows how coplanar and nearly coplanar polygons can be merged into larger complex polygons and re-triangulated into fewer simple polygons than originally required. The notable contributions of this paper are: 1) a method for quickly grouping polygons into nearly coplanar sets, 2) a fast approach for merging coplanar polygon sets and, 3) a simple, robust triangulation method for polygons created by 1 and 2. The central idea of the algorithm is the notion of treating polygonal data as a collection of segments and removing redundant segments to quickly from polygon hulls which represent the merged coplanar sets.},

@book{Gersho1991,
abstract = {This book is devoted to the theory and practice of signal compression; i.e. data compression applied to signals such as speech, audio, images and video signals. The emphasis is on the conversion of analog waveforms into efficient digital representations and on the compression of digital information into the fewest possible bits. Both operations should yield the highest possible reconstruction fidelity subject to constraints on the bit rate and implementation complexity. The conversion of signals into such efficient digital representations has several goals: to minimize the communication capacity required for transmission of high quality signals such as speech and images or, equivalently, to obtain the best possible fidelity over an available communication channel; to minimize the storage capacity required for saving such information in fast storage media and in archival data bases or, equivalently, to obtain the best possible quality for the largest amount of information stored in a given medium; to provide the simplest possible accurate descriptions of a signal so as to minimize the subsequent complexity of signal processing algorithms such as classification, transformation and encryption. In addition to these common goals of communication, storage, and signal processing systems, efficient coding of both analog and digital information is intimately connected to a variety of other fields such as pattern recognition, image classification, speech recognition, cluster analysis regression, and decision tree design. Thus techniques from each field can often be extended to another and combined signal processing operations can take advantage of the similar algorithm structures and designs. This book has been written for use in a graduate course on quantization and signal compression and represents the most comprehensive reference available for research scientists and practitioners working in fields related to the topic.},

Our analysis establishes the existence of a simple description of persistent homology groups over arbitrary fields. It also enables us to derive a natural algorithm for computing persistent homology of spaces in arbitrary dimension over any field. This result generalizes and extends the previously known algorithm that was restricted to subcomplexes of S3 and Z2 coefficients. Finally, our study implies the lack of a simple classification over non-fields. Instead, we give an algorithm for computing individual persistent homology groups over an arbitrary principal ideal domain in any dimension.},

@article{Corsini2012,
abstract = {Scientific and technological advances in the fields of telecommunications, 3D acquisition, rendering and geometry processing have boosted the diffusion of 3D digital data mainly in the form of 3D static and dynamic triangle meshes. In this context, many processing operations are commonly applied on these 3D data including filtering, denoising, simplification, watermarking or compression. These processes are mostly driven and/or evaluated using simple distortion measures like the Hausdorff distance or root mean square error, however these measures do not correlate well with the human visual perception. For this reason, some objective quality metrics have been introduced. Their goal is to produce a score that predicts the subjective visual quality (or the visual impact of the distortion) of the processed 3D model with respect to a reference (distortion-free) model. Such metrics are of major importance for computer graphics. They provide a new paradigm for the evaluation, control and optimization of many kinds of processing operations. This survey aims at presenting existing perceptually-based metrics for static and dynamic 3D meshes, their evaluation and several applications including compression and watermarking.},

Radical new technology is much more likely to succeed when it brings an artist's workflow into a new regime, providing a discontinuous improvement in efficiency and final image quality. More modest technology revisions can supply smaller speed-ups, but these are merely consumed by Blinn's Law, i.e., the tendency for system response times to remain constant as technology improves, due to increased input complexity.

@incollection{Vilbrandt2008,
abstract = {Advances in digital design and fabrication technologies are leading toward single fabrication systems capable of producing almost any complete functional object. We are proposing a new paradigm for manufacturing, which we call Universal Desktop Fabrication (UDF), and a framework for its development. UDF will be a coherent system of volumetric digital design software able to handle infinite complexity at any spatial resolution and compact, automated, multi-material digital fabrication hardware. This system aims to be inexpensive, simple, safe and intuitive to operate, open to user modification and experimentation, and capable of rapidly manufacturing almost any arbitrary, complete, high-quality, functional object. Through the broad accessibility and generality of digital technology, UDF will enable vastly more individuals to become innovators of technology, and will catalyze a shift from specialized mass production and global transportation of products to personal customization and point-of-use manufacturing. Likewise, the inherent accuracy and speed of digital computation will allow processes that significantly surpass the practical complexity of the current design and manufacturing systems. This transformation of manufacturing will allow for entirely new classes of human-made, peerproduced, micro-engineered objects, resulting in more dynamic and natural interactions with the world. We describe and illustrate our current results in UDF hardware and software, and describe future development directions.},
